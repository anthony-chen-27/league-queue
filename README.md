# League-Queue
Very simple queueing system
Frontend: React

Backend: Node.js, Express, Express-ws

Players enter the queue, and players' name are broadcasted to everyone else on the site through websockets.
Once the specfied number of players has entered the queue (3), backend will respond by matching the players and the page will also display links to each player's OP.GG profile
